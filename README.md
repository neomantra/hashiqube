# HashiQube - A Development Lab Using All the HashiCorp Products

![HashiQube](images/hashiqube-banner.png?raw=true "HashiQube ")

## Overview

Hashiqube is a Docker Container (Default) or a Virtual Machine VM (Virtualbox). Hashiqube has a Docker daemon inside. It runs all Hashicorp products. [Vault](/vault/?id=vault), [Terraform](/terraform/?id=terraform), [Nomad](/nomad/?id=nomad), [Consul](/consul/?id=consul), [Waypoint](/waypoint/?id=waypoint), [Boundary](/boundary/?id=boundary), [Vagrant](/vagrant/?id=vagrant), [Packer](/packer/?id=packer) and [Sentinel](/sentinel/?id=sentinel).

It also runs a host of other popular Open Source DevOps / DevSecOps applications (Minikube, Ansible AWX Tower, Traefik etc.) showcasing how simple integration with Hashicorp products can result in tangible learnings and benefits for all its users.

Once Hashiqube is up an internet connection is no longer needed meaning sales pitches and demos for potential and existing customers is greatly aided.

Hashiqube has been created to help Engineers, Developers and anyone who wants to practise, learn or demo HashiCorp products to get started quickly with a local lab.

## Pre-requisites
* 10GB of disk space and 4G Ram (Minimum) `vagrant up --provision` 8G Ram Recommended
* Admin rights / sudo
* Docker (Default) or Virtualbox
* Vagrant
* `vagrant up --provision`

:bulb: If you want to run Minikube and a workload like AWX Ansible Tower, or Airflow you need at least 8G Ram - If you want to run Gitlab aswell, you need to give Docker resources at least 12G Ram

## Installation Instructions
:clock3: Duration 15 - 30 minutes <br>
:bulb: Docker is the Default and preferred way to run Hashiqube

* Docker - Download __Docker__ from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop and install
* Vagrant - Download __Vagrant__ from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html and install
* Virtualbox (Optional) - Download __Virtualbox__ from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and install
* Using `git` - clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/star3am/hashiqube.git` [__What is Git?__](git/#git)
* Inside the local repo folder, do `vagrant up --provision` - This will setup, Vault, Nomad, Consul, Terraform, Localstack and Docker
* Documentation locally available at http://localhost:3333

## Documentation and Status

## HashiQube Diagrams

In essence Hashiqube is a Docker Container (by default) or a Virtual Machine.

Hashiqube has a Docker Daemon inside meaning we can run docker containers / pods inside Hashiqube using Kubernetes or Nomad or Docker run.

Hashiqube runs on your local laptop, PC or a cloud instance.

Hashiqube runs all the Hashicorp products and other popular Open Source tools, such as Minikube, Ansible AWX Tower, Prometheus and Grafana and many, many more, See [__Hashiqube Integrations__](/?id=hashiqube-integrations)

You can also run Hashiqube on AWS, GCP and Azure. This is called Hashiqube Multi-Cloud, see: [__Multi-Cloud__](multi-cloud/README)

Hashiqube is a Training / Development Lab for you to practise, learn or demo POC stuff with, it should not be run in production.

Hashiqube can be visualized with the diagrams below.

## HashiQube's Purpose
Hashiqube has been created to enable anyone who is interested in secure automation pipelines the ability to run a suite of ‘best in class’ tools their local machines at the cost of a small amount of system resources.

Hashiqube gives all interested parties the empowerment to  deploy these tools in a way covers multiple use cases effectively providing a ‘concept to completion’ test bed using open source Hashicorp products.

The original use case was born the desire to demystify DevSecOps utilising Terraform, Vault, Consul, Sentinel and Nomad as well as some other well know open source CI/CD tools by providing a ‘hands-on’ environment that demonstrates the value of secret and credential management in a standard software development pipeline.

Thanks to the flexibility of the Hashicorp products there is no need to wonder how to achieve the goals of bringing software to market in a more secure and timely fashion, just Vagrant up!

## Supported Architectures
| Name | Docker | Virtualbox | Hyper-V
|------|--------|------------|---------|
| amd64 | ✓ | ✓ | ✘ |
| arm64 | ✓ | ✘ | ✘ |
| linux | ✓ | ✓ | ✘ |
| windows | ✓ | ✘ | ✘ |
| mac intel | ✓ | ✓ | ✘ |
| mac apple | ✓ | ✘ | ✘ |

## Components
Hashiqube is made up out of a number of components and some rely on each other. 

For example you can run components seperately as demonstrated below.
```bash
vagrant up --provision-with basetools
vagrant up --provision-with docker
vagrant up --provision-with docsify
vagrant up --provision-with vault
vagrant up --provision-with nomad
vagrant up --provision-with minikube
```

Or one-shot as demonstrated below.
```bash
vagrant up --provision-with basetools,docker,minikube,postgresql,dbt,apache-airflow
```

#### Docker Desktop
Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac or Windows environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. It's a graphical user interface for the docker service.

* Download __Docker Desktop__ from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop and install it on your laptop, to verify bring up the Docker Desktop application. 

If you have HashiQube running, you won't see any containers but you will be able to open the application. 

![Docker Desktop](images/docker_desktop_installed.png?raw=true "Docker Desktop")

Now that docker is installed we need to ensure that the docker environment and settings are configured

- Ensure you have the latest version installed
- Ensure that your Operating System is updated see: https://www.docker.com/blog/speed-boost-achievement-unlocked-on-docker-desktop-4-6-for-mac/

##### Docker Desktop Resources

:bulb: You can quite happily run Hashiqube with 4G (minimum)  or 8G (recommended) of RAM, but once you start running, Vault, Nomad, Consul, Waypoint, Boundary AND you want to run Minikube with let's say AWX Ansible Tower at the same time, the processes will start contending for resources and you will get weird errors. For that reason, below screenshot is my setup with 12G of RAM. For reference I use an M1 Macbook Air with 16G or RAM as my personal laptop. I frequently run all of HashiQube's services to test with, for example, I'll run Vault, Nomad, Consul, Waypoint, Boundary and Minikube with Grafana and Prometheus to test the monitoring of Vault, Nomad and Consul, for that reason 4G Ram would not be enough.

![Docker Desktop Resources](images/docker_installed_resources.png?raw=true "Docker Desktop Resources")

* Ensure that you give your docker daemon at least __8G of RAM__ and sufficient disk space

## Consul DNS
__Local DNS via Consul__ <br />
Add on our local Macbook a file __/etc/resolver/consul__ with below contents
```
nameserver 10.9.99.10
port 8600
```
Now you can use DNS like nomad.service.consul:9999 vault.service.consul:9999 via Fabio Load Balancer <br />

__Error__ Vagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they would collide with some other application that is already listening on these ports. The forwarded port to `9200` is already in use on the host machine.

To fix this, modify your current project's Vagrantfile to use another port. Example, where '1234' would be replaced by a unique host port: 

```
config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 9200, host: 1234
```

Sometimes, Vagrant will attempt to auto-correct this for you. In this case, Vagrant was unable to. This is usually because the guest machine is in a state which doesn't allow modifying port forwarding. You could try 'vagrant reload' (equivalent of running a halt followed by an up) so vagrant can attempt to auto-correct this upon booting. Be warned that any unsaved work might be lost. <br />
__Command__ `vagrant up --provision` <br />
__Info__ When I run `vagrant up` I get an error about a port collision, in this case it is port `9200` - The reason is that I have an Elasticsearch container running on my local laptop, and since HashiQube also run Elasticsearch this port is taken. <br />
__Solution__ I stop the Elasticsearch docker container and I run `vagrant up` again, or I hash the line out in the Vagrantfile like the example below <br />

```
# config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 9200, host: 9200 # elasticsearch
```
